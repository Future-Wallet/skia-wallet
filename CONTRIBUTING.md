## How do we manage the new task, issues, features...?

We have all the jobs done, in progress and to-do on our [Github's Project](https://github.com/Future-Wallet/skia-wallet/projects).

---

## Rules to follow when contributing to the code

- To name the variables/classes, to document, to create constructors, etc; we follow the rules of [Google's convention for Typescript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html). Extras:
  - Comment on third person. Eg. `It gets the property` instead of `We get the property`.
- Before commit your first code, follow the [Commits guide](https://github.com/Future-Wallet/skia-wallet/wiki/Commits).
- Test-Driven Design. A must for the layers Entities, Repositories and Common. Not necessary on the UI packages for now.
